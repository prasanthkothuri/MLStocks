# Trying to predict stock price movement with modern Neural Network techniques like RNN, LSTM & MLP
This is a WIP repository
## The general workflow is as follows
1. Get the stock prices for a given ticker / set of tickers
2. Prepare the data (numpy arrays which go as input to NNs)
3. NN algoritm to train on the data and output model (in .hd5 format)
4. Backtesting (WIP)
